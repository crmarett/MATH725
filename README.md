# MATH725
This repo contains the code for my algorithm for my MATH725 Project, as well as a .py file (example.py) that, when run, offers to either run some examples or run the algorithm on a sequence input by the user. Because the paper only defines a_k and b_k for k in [f], the matrix printed is fxn and not nxn.
